# How to use it

```
pb path/to/data.json
```

The Personal Backlog has a TODO list feature and a Calendar feature.

a - will add a TODO item. It will ask you for a title, then for an estimate in points, then for a priority. The smaller the more important.

s - will add a Scheduled item, a calendar event. It will ask for a title, a start date, a start time, end date, end time, location. 


## Edit an item:

* First list the items
* Then type in `e N` where N is the order number of the item in the current listing.
